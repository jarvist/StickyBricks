;When set to 1 there is a wall at z=0, when set to 2 there is also
;a wall at z=z_box. Walls can only be used with pbc=xy. When set to 2
;pressure coupling and Ewald summation can be used (it is usually best
;to use semiisotropic pressure coupling with the x/y compressibility
;set to 0, as otherwise the surface area will change). Energy groups
;wall0 and wall1 (for nwall=2) are added automatically to monitor the
;interaction of energy groups with each wall. The center of mass motion
